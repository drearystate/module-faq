Contents:

Faq.php: This file likely contains the main form structure for adding or editing FAQs.

Faq (Directory): Contains additional form components or structures related to the FAQ feature. The exact content can vary based on the specific requirements of the module.

2. Model:
Handles the data structures, relations, and operations (CRUD) for the module.

Contents:

Faq.php: Defines the primary data structure and methods for CRUD operations on FAQs.

Db (Directory): Contains database-related files. From the original documentation:

Schema definition files (table_name.php) which describe the database tables.
Files that reflect the database in its latest version. Any updates to the module would require a comparison against these files.
3. controllers:
Manages the business logic, request/response handling, and the interaction between the frontend and backend.

Contents:

ApplicationController.php: Manages main operations for the FAQ module in the SiberianCMS back office.

Mobile (Directory): Contains controllers specific to the mobile frontend. These controllers handle how FAQs are presented and interacted with in the mobile app.

4. features:
Crucial for integrating the FAQ module as a feature within SiberianCMS mobile apps.

Contents:

faq (Directory): Contains core files related to the FAQ feature in mobile apps. This would include:
feature.json: Defines the feature's properties, routes, layouts, icons, files, and other configurations. This file is essential for the feature's integration and behavior within the app.
5. resources:
A central directory housing various assets, configurations, and design elements for the FAQ module.

Contents:

db (Directory): Contains database schemas and initial data. This would include:

schema: Files that define the structure of database tables.
data: Files that insert default values during module installation or updates.
design (Directory): Contains design assets, templates, and styles ensuring the FAQ module aligns well with SiberianCMS design guidelines. This might include:

CSS stylesheets for the module's look and feel.
JavaScript files for frontend interactivity.
Image assets and layouts.
Templates defining the structure and layout of the module's pages.
translations (Directory): Contains localization files for the module. This ensures it can be translated into different languages. The module uses .po files for this purpose.

6. package.json:
A vital file for the SiberianCMS installer. It informs the installer about the module, its requirements, dependencies, and routines to run during installation or updates.
